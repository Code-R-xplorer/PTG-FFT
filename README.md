# Procedural Terrain Generation using Fast Fourier Transform Filtering

## Overview
This repo holds the source code for Procedural Terrain Generation tool. You can run the tool in your browser on the tool's itch page [here](https://coderxplorer.itch.io/ptg).

## The Tool
This tool is a showcase of a procedural terrain generation (PTG) using fast Fourier transform (FFT). With this tool you can create a range of terrains by modifying the values used to generate them. You can control the overall size of the generated mesh, the smoothness of the terrain, how high the terrain is and so on. This project acts purely as a showcase and is not intended for production use. You can use the tool in the browser or on Windows.

## About the Developer
It was developed by Harry Vallance initially as a part of his MSc at Goldsmiths, University of London 2023 - 2024. He then extended the tool in his free time to release the tool. It was made using Unity Engine 2022.
